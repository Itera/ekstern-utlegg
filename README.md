# Itera External Expenses

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Itera/ekstern-utlegg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Itera/ekstern-utlegg)

A very simple angularjs app that allows external/students to provide a standard cover page for expenses.

It holds the data in an angular model local to the browser - and has no server component other than that required
to serve the angular app via heroku. No user data is sent over the network.
